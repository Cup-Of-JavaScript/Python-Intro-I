# Ex. 1 Hello World
Create a Python function named `hello_world` that accepts a string 
that represents the number of times the following message is 
printed on the console: `Hello World from Python!`.  This function
must convert the string to an integer and must use a for loop to 
print the message to the console.

Usage: 
```python
hello_world("3")
```

Output:
```
Hello World from Python!
Hello World from Python!
Hello World from Python!
```

# Ex. 2 Array to String
Create a Python function named `array_to_string` that accepts an array of `ints` and returns a string. 
The function must use a for loop and must cast the `ints` to `strings`.

Usage:
```python
array = [1, 2, 3]
result = array_to_string(array)
print(result)
```

Output:
```
1 2 3
```

# Ex. 3 Add Numbers
Create a Python function named `add_numbers` that accepts an array of numeric types and returns the sum of 
them as a float value. The function must use a for loop and must cast the numbers to `floats`.

Usage:
```python
array = [1.0, 1.1, "1"]
result = add_numbers(array)
print(result)
```

Output:
```
3.1
```

# Ex. 4 Calculate Total
Create a Python function named `calc_total` that accepts an array of ints and a string that represents the sales tax.
Formatting currency in Python is accomplished in the following manner:

```python
number = 1.00
dollar_number = "${:,.2f}".format(number)
```

[String slicing](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-index-and-slice-strings-in-python-3) may help you.

Usage:
```python
array = [2.00, 4.00, 4.00]
tax = "10%"
result = calc_total(array, tax)
print(result)
```

Ouput:
```
$11.00
```
